# CSE3311-Team2-Fall2021
This repository if for Team 2's CSE3311 Project for fall 2021

# Project Vision
"As a team we want to create a changeable itinerary for UTA exchange students in japan that includes all necessary information so that students need not seek external information. This will include a pdf covering Japanese basics, an updateable calendar, and a list of notable locations. This will not include a messaging app or a replacement for any online communication or emergency communication. The login will only be accessible to those with a UTA login and correct privileges (those going on the trip)."

# Competitors
* Google Calander - Improved by making UTA specific, and providing offline helpful information
* Prava - Improved by including japan specific information and adding the ability to work offline
* Tripline - Improved by offline functionality
